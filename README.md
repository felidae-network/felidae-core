# Felidae Network Node

This repo contains the code for the felidae network blockchain.

## Node Setup

This node has been tested for Ubuntu version 20.04.

#### Install dependencies

Use a terminal shell to execute the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt update
# May prompt for location information
sudo apt install -y cmake pkg-config libssl-dev git build-essential clang libclang-dev curl
```
#### Rust Developer Environment

This project uses [`rustup`](https://rustup.rs/) to help manage the Rust toolchain. First install
and configure `rustup`:

```bash
# Install
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
# Configure
source ~/.cargo/env
```

Finally, configure the Rust toolchain:

```bash
rustup default stable
rustup update nightly
rustup update stable
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown --toolchain nightly
```

### Run

Use Rust's native `cargo` command to build and launch the template node:

```sh
cargo run --release -- --dev --tmp
```

### Build

The `cargo run` command will perform an initial build. Use the following command to build the node
without launching it:

```sh
cargo build --release
```

### Embedded Docs

Once the project has been built, the following command can be used to explore all parameters and
subcommands:

```sh
./target/release/felidae -h
```

## Run

The provided `cargo run` command will launch a temporary node and its state will be discarded after
you terminate the process. After the project has been built, there are other ways to launch the
node.

### Single-Node Development Chain

This command will start the single-node development chain with persistent state:

```bash
./target/release/felidae --dev
```

Purge the development chain's state:

```bash
./target/release/felidae purge-chain --dev
```

Start the development chain with detailed logging:

```bash
RUST_LOG=debug RUST_BACKTRACE=1 ./target/release/felidae -lruntime=debug --dev
```

### Node

A blockchain node is an application that allows users to participate in a blockchain network.

After the node has been [built](#build), refer to the embedded documentation to learn more about the
capabilities and configuration parameters that it exposes:

```shell
./target/release/felidae --help
```
